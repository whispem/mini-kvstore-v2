# Contributing to mini-kvstore-v2

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines to keep the codebase clear and productive:

## How to contribute

- Fork the repository, then create a feature branch.
- Format code with `cargo fmt` before each PR.
- Run and add tests (`cargo test`).
- Limit pull requests to a single logical change when possible.
- Describe why the change is valuable in your PR.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with a short reproduction case or error message.
If relevant, include OS/platform, Rust version, and steps to reproduce.

## Code style & philosophy

- Code should favor clarity and explicitness over extreme optimization.
- Prefer idiomatic Rust, with comments for less-obvious patterns.
- New features should be modular and covered by tests.
